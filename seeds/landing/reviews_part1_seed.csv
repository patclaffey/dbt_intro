It is in a great hip area with tons of great independent designer boutiques, lovely restaurants and art galleries. When we arrived there was even a farmers market just steps away from her door. She gave great directions to get to her place and her business partner was happily waiting there when we arrived. He gave us great suggestions on what to do in the city and sat down with us for about an hour explaining great walks and great places to see in Berlin. Her place was clean, tidy and everything that we needed to stay there for the three nights. If we ever get a chance to go to Berlin again, we would definitely stay here again",positive

My husband and I loved the apartment and were very sad when we had to leave. Everything was very comfortable and you could not ask for a better location. We made sure to see other areas as well (Charlottenberg, Kreuzberg, FSchein, etc), and nothing compares to the lovliness of this section of Prenzlauer Berg. It is our hope that we can find an apartment just like Brittas so that we can spend more time in Berlin.",positive

3176,2012-07-31T00:00:00Z,Sven,"We spent one week in Berlin at this amazing flat in a simply wonderful location. With a daughter of 16months old, Prenzlauer Berg I would say is the perfect place to enjoy Berlin whilst allowing your child to explore what seemed to be a sandpit on every corner of every block brEqually as adults we enjoyed the amazing choice of restaurants in the neighbourhood. We did travel to other areas of this vast sprawling city, but couldnt wait to get back to the calmness of this light and airy flat and its tree lined surroundings We would most definitely recommend staying in this apartment. We would love to come back and stay here again and explore this fantastic city ",positive

Loved the neighbourhood, so easy to get around and way better than staying in a hotel. Only thing I would add is it would be nice to be able to leave bags there on check out day. We had to check out at 11am which seemed quite early and as we werent flying the the evening it would have been nice to have the option for a late check out, or somewhere to leave bags in the building",positive
3176,2012-09-30T00:00:00Z,Beck,"The apartment was great, couldnt have been happier. The neighbourhood has lots of characterlots going on but is still peaceful to go to sleep at night. 1015 minute walks to be in the heart of the action and really close to the train and tram systems. The apartment has great space (could easily hold a small family or 4 people if using the day bed) and has lovely natural light all throughout. brCommunication with Maarten was incredible, he always got back to us really quickly and kindly arranged a last minute booking late at night. brIf I go back to Berlin Id definitely try and get this place again.brThanks Maarten (and Britta and Marcus.)",positive
3176,2012-10-26T00:00:00Z,Dominique,"We really enjoyed our Short break holiday in Berlin and this beautiful flat was certainly part of it. We couldnt have picked a better flat. It is exactly as described. It is located on the first floor and we thought it was very quiet and very homely. We had tons of space for the two of us. The bed is also very comfortable (I have a dodgy back). The location was perfect. We were spoilt for choice regarding restaurants or cafés as there are about 10 (more even) just around the house : we did like Endlos (leaving the house, turn left and cross the road). The underground station is only 5 minutes away, the tram to Alexander Platz is at the end of the road. Or Alexander Platz itself is only a 1015 minute stroll. From there you can travel anywhere in the city. We found that we could walk to a lot of landmarks (Brandenburger Tor, Dom, Reichstag etc.) very easily. The supermarket (organic) is down the road (turn left and walk for about 23 minutes). In a nutshell we loved it and wed definitely be back. ",neutral
3176,2012-11-07T00:00:00Z,Tijn & Corinne,"The location off the apartment is the best, smack in the middle of all the action: bars  restaurants  shops. The apartment self is nice and spacious the only things what we missed was a coffeemachine, so you didnt have to get dressed to go outside to get our first coffee, a little radio would have been nice also, just to bring some liveliness in to the apartment. And 1 roll of toiletpaper for 4 days isnt enough ;)  Contact with Maarten  Britta and there manager Marcus was strict and business.

Markets, restaurants, cafes and parks, and the metro and tram are all really close and everything is easy to get to.brAll our communication with Britta and Maarten, and Marcus, was quick and easy and they were always very helpful. The apartment itself could not have been better. It is really peaceful, light and roomy and has everything we needed.

The flat is quite, with character and perfectly situated just near Kolwillplatz where you can start the day with a perfect brunch. We found Prenzlauer Berg was one of the most charming neighbourhoods in Berlin but its easy, as we did, to rent bikes around the corner or take the trammetro within a short walking distance to explore the other parts of the city. Preparatory communication by email with Britta was straightforward and clear and Marcus welcomed us simply and nicely despite our late arrival, helping us to really enjoy our stay.",positive

Great shopping, great sightseeing, lovely food en great markets all around. There just a minor thing to mention, if you stay here with someone you like but you dont want to sleep lepeltjelepeltje (Dutch expression for sleeping really close to each other), the bed could be too small so someone has to sleep in the daybed, which is fine but in the living room.

The apartment itself  was nice and they were able to provide a crib and high chair. The water heater went out twice. The first time a plumber was sent and the second time we were able to reset the pilot light ourselves. The lack of hot water was inconvenient, especially with a baby, but Britta and her management company were helpful and responsive. This was the first AirBnB property I have stayed in (over 20x) that was run by a service rather than a host who was present. We paid an extra 20 for arriving after 9PM.

Não a conhecemos pessoalmente, mas fomos recebidos de forma bastante profissional por uma pessoa por ela indicada, que nos deu todas as informações necessárias. O apartamento é espaçoso, com uma sala bem ampla integrada com a cozinha, um quarto de casal e um banheiro bem grande. O apartamento é vazado, bem iluminado e bem ventilado. Fica no primeiro andar, o que é muito bom porque muitos dos prédios da região são antigos e não tem elevador. A rua tem muitos restaurantes, muita vida, mas dentro do apartamento não se ouve o barulho. Estivemos lá no verão e as mesas eram recolhidas pouco depois das dez da noite. Toalhas e roupa de cama muito limpas, branquinhas, e bastante água quente no chuveiro. Cozinha muito bem aparelhada, com pratos, louças e panelas e até temperos de todos os tipos. Fui eu e minha mulher, mas havia espaço para acomodar nossos filhos tranquilamente, inclusive um berço dobráveis. A localização é nota dez. Prenzlauer Berg é um bairro muito bacana, que no fim do século 19 foi uma região operária, virou uma área preferida dos artistas e pessoal alternativo logo depois da queda do muro de Belim e mais recentemente passou por um processo de gentrificação. Dezenas de bons restaurantes nos quarteirões em volta, um batia centro cultural que foi construído numa antiga cervejaria, lojas de objeto de decoração e arte e roupas de segunda mão e uma feira de verduras orgânicas e artesanato nos sábado. Bem perto de uma linha de bonde e relativamente perto do metro. Foi uma excelente escolha, e voltaremos com certeza ao mesmo apartamento se tivermos uma oportunidade no futuro.",neutral

The Apartments location is fabulous  right next to the U Ban subway and nearby to many cafes and restaurants. The Room is located towards an inner courtyard and is very quite. The room  is very clean and well decorated, Can the owner is an Artist and has great taste.

Since the host is an artist the interior design is minimal with just the right hint of color using bits of his own work to accent it though there is plenty of unobtrusive furniture for storage, seating and a desk for organizing and computer equipment. Even though there was a cooling tendency outside with occasional rain the two heaters under the windows very subtly warmed the room. The directions to the place from the airport cost me a bus and a subway token instead of an expensive cab ride. Its located close to Alexanderplatz, an important city center, and all the tour bus connections a new visitor to the city could need and the hosts graciousness and advice sealed the experience with a fond memory.",neutral

You are on the second story which has 2 flights of stairs for each level so if you cant walk up stairs then this could be an issue but thats the case in Europe. It was very clean and we were met as arranged and given full instructions and hints and tips. Its also under 2 klm to walk to the bite club if u r going there in summer and WIFI was good .

Perfect for two people could be a bit tight if its anyone else. The negatives the Internet was pretty terrible it would randomly stop working all of a sudden and went it did work it was really slow. The shower was really bad, we were wondering when we arrived why there was a random bucket in the bathroom with soak towels but we soon found out that it was impossible to shower without the bathroom floor filling up with water.

It was very hard to use the shower without getting the whole bathroom floor soaking wet. The only setting I could find that didnt spray everywhere was with the shower pointing 20 at my body and 80 at the shower wall, so not the most enjoyable wakeup on a cold Berlin morning. This seemed to be due to the shower head being mounted right at the edge of the shower, instead of in the middle of it, so you had to spray the water horizontally instead of down the way, to avoid it going all over the bathroom.brbrOverall, fantastic value and location. Just one star deducted because if the silly shower.",neutral

The apartment is a fairly large studio and it is adjacent to a beautiful canal and openair Turkish Market, so grabbing a quick breakfast or coffee was as simple as stepping outside and walking just a few feet. Also, there were several great cafes, bars, and markets near by. There are many public transit options in the neighborhood as well.brbrI did not get the chance to meet Matthias, but Friedrich (from the building ) greeted me warmly and described the apartment to me. I was having some issues with international text messages with my phone but I was able to coordinate a checkin using the Airbnb app. Although Matthias was away he was easy to reach via Airbnbemail.brbrI would definitely stay at the studio again and I think it is a very good value. And the location couldnt be better. The only issue I had was with the style of the bathroom (for example, the shower curtain had to be carefully secured to ensure no water escaped) but I feel this is a fairly minor issue and I got the hang of it after a couple days. brbrSo Id like to thank Matthias and Friedrich for the opportunity to stay at the Kreuzberg Studio.

The only downside to this place as mentioned by other guests is the bathroom situation isnt great everytime you would have a shower the water leaked onto the floor. There was a mop and bucket n the bathroom for me to mop up floors after everytime I showered. It wasnt ideal to do this while Im on holidays. The toilet also leaked almost everytime you flushed. The reason I noticed the toilet was leaking was because I started showering at the gym so the puddle of water on the bathroom floor was from the toilet. Fredric did warn about the toilet leaking and the bathroom leaking but these issues arent ideal to deal with on holidays. Apart from this, everything else was fine and the accomodation is in a great spot and has nice natural sunlight coming into the apartment. Overall, I had a nice stay. ",neutral

There is a market on the weekends where you can buy cheap groceries, plus cafés everywhere, a pharmacy, two supermarkets... Really practical. It also helped that some nightlife targets (Schwuz, Berghain) were easy to get to from here, as well as film places (Moviemento).brbrRegarding the place itself, it is a small studio, with a sofabed on the main space, and another bed elevated on a platform: I had no trouble at all getting sleep, and the space was more than sufficient for my needs. Neighbors are quiet, and all utilities work perfectly (I stayed there in Januarynot the coldest January, but cold still). I was able to cook all my breakfasts and some main meals with no trouble at all. Needless to say, the space was spotless when I arrived.brbrRegarding communication, Matthias was superdiligent, and arranged a way for me to get the key even when the building manager was out.brbrIf I were to mention any shortcomings, I would only say it has no elevator, in case you have very large luggage pieces.

Three times every week there is an interesting market in front of the house (there is no noise into the house because of this).

It was clear that nobody lives in this apartment by a few little things that could be better.  For example, there is no place to put your soap or shampoo in the shower (except the floor) and there is no dresser in the master bedroom  little things that did not really affect our stay but made it clear that this is a rental apartment.  When we arrived at the airport and called the contact person to ask for assistance in taking public transit to the apartment the man could not tell us what subway stop to use.  I think his exact words were Dont you have a map.  We did but were tired from a long night of travel so we took a cab.  Turns out the public transit system is excellent (as we expected it to be) and is very convenient to the apartment and we used it for our entire stay without problem.  The apartment itself is bright and airy with tall ceilings.  We LOVED it.  We loved that it was close to Mauer park, a nice grocery store and loads of great restaurants, shops and merchants.

There was no double duvet, only 3 singles 2 of which had no covers. . Towels provided were clean but small. If staying in the summer non of the blinds block light out. It is not great for kids, the guy below complained that our two year old was too noisey when he ran around in the flat. And although there is a lift we still had to negotiate two flights of stairs with the buggy. The washing machine broke when we were there and it took 6 days to get it fixed, during which time our wet clothes were stuck inside and we couldnt wash anything.

20858,2017-07-12T00:00:00Z,Jen,"I stayed at Marcs place with my partner and our two small children for six days this summer. We wanted to stay in Prenzlauerberg, because we had heard it was a great location to stay in Berlin with family. Marcs flat was in a perfect location  close to public transportation, shops, restaurants, grocery stores, and parks. Although it was lively, it was quiet up in our apartment. And it was wonderful to have so much space with so many of us.brbrWe never actually communicated with Marc, but with Jorg, the property manager. The company manages 35 or so properties around Berlin. Check in was great, and we met with a lovely lady who was on time, friendly, provided us with lots of information, and even helped us with our bags.brbrI would describe the flat as fairly clean  the dishes in the cupboard were dirty, as was a towel in the bathroom, but other than that, it was good.brbrUpon choosing a place to stay, I wanted to make sure we had a washing machine, as we didnt want to bring too many things along. We quickly found out that the washer was broken (the service light was on when we arrived), which was a huge disappointment. I contacted Jorg by email, and when I didnt hear back, by phone and he answered right away. He got back  to me later, telling me that he couldnt get someone to come and look at the washer until the day before we left  very inconvenient for us. On top of that, our clothes were trapped in the washer (which we finally managed to get out on our own).brbrThere were a couple other things that could have made our stay better: we were responsible for purchasing everything for the apartment ourselves (e.g., dish washing detergent, dish washer detergent, toilet paper, garbage bags, etc.). We found this strange, as weve never had to do this before and because the flat was not inexpensive in the first place. As well, the wifi did not work well.brbrOverall, we enjoyed our stay at Marcs place, but we thought it would have been excellent, had there been more attention to these details.",neutral
20858,2017-07-16T00:00:00Z,Lene,"The location is unbeatable  really a great neighbourhood and a very nice building The apartment itself is also very nice  completly as you see in the photos along with a really beautiful and large bathroom. brHowever, its not your typical Airbnb experience. As others wrote before, a professional service firm takes care of handing over the key  and not much else. The women who met us there, didnt know anything about the neighbourhood and questions about how to get to the apartment from the central station went unanswered  also by Marc. Several light bulbs were not working and noone seems to notice that (Marc did say he would get it fixed though) It took me a whole day to find out the WIFI code (yellow tape on the fridge FYI :) There are also two great balconies but strangely enough no table or chairs or even a plant there, which makes them hard to use. brA neighbour stopped me to tell me that it was illegal to rent out the apartment via AirBnB. I do believe Marc has a license but its not so pleasant. Maybe neighbours should be informed.brKnowing all this I would still recommend the place for its great location and nice decor  but maybe not if you are planning to stay for weeks. The beds have very thin mattresses and are quite uncomfortable",neutral

It was a great base to explore Berlin for our family of 3 (2 adults  a baby).  The neighborhood couldnt be better  tree lined streets lined with cute houses and filled with cafes, restaurants, and boutique shops.  It made use feel like locals in Berlin rather than some tourists.  Despite the complaints  in other reviews about the checkin process, we find Jörg (who checked us in) quite friendly and helpful.  The biggest issues we had with the apt were 1) its uncomfortable beds (like many other reviews have already mentioned); 2) the elevator only stops in between floors so we still had to lift our stroller through two long flights of stairs on both ends every time in and out of the apt.  On the positive side, the apt has so many babyfriendly features which comes very handy if you are traveling with a young baby (portable crib, high chair, baby furniture, etc.).

For a sofa bed, the main pullout is not bad at all, big enough for two to share without running into each other. However, getting the second bed out makes things very crowded indeed  best for two to share. Its in one of the cooler neighborhoods in Berlin, so lots of little coffee shops, bars and restaurants, plus parks to wander around in, which was great. Very upandcoming trendy. This place though is definitely run professionally, even though its in an apartment complex with locals, so if thats not what you want, take note  its a teensy bit sterile. ",positive
